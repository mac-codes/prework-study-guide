# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project is a Prework study guide for my KU bootcamp course. I built this project to practice what we will be doing in class, as well as for notes to use during my time at the KU bootcamp. This will help me when I cannot remember something or need help refeshing my mind when I need to do something. I learned so much in the making of this study guide. HTML, CSS, GIT, and JAVASCRIPT
